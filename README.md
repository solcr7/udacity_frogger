Project # 3 for my Udacity Frontend Nanodegree

* [Project Specifications](#project-specifications)

## Instructions:
* Clone or download the repository.
* Open the zip.file on your computer.
* Extract the files.
* Open index.html in a browser of your choice and start playing.

## How to play:
* Move the player using the arrow keys.
* Try to reach the water without colliding with one of the enemies. Every time you reach the water, you will 
  gain 25 points and your player will be reset to the starting line for a new round.
* While trying to reach the water, you can collect gems. Each collected gem brings you 50 points.
  Every time a new round begins, a new gem will be appear on the field.
* You begin with a total of 3 lives. Every time you collide with an enemy you will lose one life and your player
  will be reset to the starting line. 
* Once you have lost all three lives, the game is over. 


## Project Specifications:

In order to pass the project I have to meet the following specifications:

### Error free code
* The game functions correctly and runs error free
  -  Player can not move off screen
  - Vehicles cross the screen
  - Vehicle-player collisions happen logically (not too early or too late)
  - Vehicle-player collision resets the game
  - Something happens when player wins
 
### Object oriented code
* Game objects (player and vehicles) are implemented using JavaScript object-oriented programming features.

### README
* A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application.

### Comments
* Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures. As a rule of thumb: describe what all custom 
  functions and object methods do.

### Code Quality
* Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udacity JavaScript Style Guide.
